# Custom Fork of the NowStreaming Firefox Add-On by [joaopsys](https://github.com/joaopsys)

## Downloading & Building:

Download the source and zip it.

`NowStreaming-Firefox$ zip ../nsfirefox.zip * -r`

 ---
**NOTE**

Make sure to run the command within the `NowStreaming-Firefox` directory.

---

Coming soon: Alternatively you can download a release with the packaged zip.

## Installing:

As I will not distribute this addon in the official firefox addon store, you can only install the *unsigned* version by sideloading it.
This is only possible in the Nightly and Developer Version of Firefox.

To sideload the addon goto [about:config](http://about:config) and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`.

-----

## Contributing:

I will accept pull requests which do not interfere with my preferred usage of this addon. Be welcomed to fork and create your own custom version.
Adding new game icons for *new* or *rather unknown* games are always gratefully taken in.

Changes made to the fork:

- remove footer from the popout
- remove fast follow from popout
- remove unfollow all, disconnect twitch, export, import from popout
- add new gameicons for TrackMania, Science & Technology
- set all gameicon image sizes to have a width of 64px, keeping aspect-ratio
- changed addon icon
